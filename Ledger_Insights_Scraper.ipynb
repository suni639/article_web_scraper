    "# Ledger Insights Articles Scraper\n",
    "\n",
    "This script scrapes article headlines, links, and publication dates from the Ledger Insights website's tokenization section. The scraped data is saved into a CSV file, appending new relevant articles each time the script is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).\n",
    "2. **Selenium WebDriver**: Install Selenium WebDriver for Python using the following command:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install selenium\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **BeautifulSoup**: Install BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML using the following command:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install beautifulsoup4\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. **ChromeDriver**: Download ChromeDriver from [chromedriver.chromium.org](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and ensure its path is correct in the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Script Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Setup*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Path to ChromeDriver**: Ensure the `webdriver_path` variable points to the correct location of your ChromeDriver executable.\n",
    "2. **Selenium WebDriver Initialization**: The script sets up the Selenium WebDriver and opens the target URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *CSV File Handling*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Append Mode**: The script opens the CSV file (`ledgerinsights_articles.csv`) in append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new one and writes the header row.\n",
    "2. **Avoiding Duplicates**: The script reads existing headlines from the CSV file to avoid duplications when appending new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Keywords for Filtering Articles*\n",
    "\n",
    "The script filters articles based on the following keywords: `digital assets`, `digital securities`, `tokenized`, `tokenization`, `bond`, `security`, `asset`, `token`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Closing Cookie Consent*\n",
    "\n",
    "The script includes a function `close_cookie_consent` to close the cookie consent dialog if it appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Loading More Articles*\n",
    "\n",
    "A bespoke feature unique to the Ledger Insights  script clicks the \"Load more\" button multiple times (adjustable by `num_clicks`) to load additional articles. If you are using a different site other than the one specified here, the code will likely fail. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Parsing and Scraping*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parsing with BeautifulSoup**: The script parses the loaded page content using BeautifulSoup.\n",
    "2. **Scraping Data**: For each article, the script extracts the headline, link, and publication date, ensuring no duplicates are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Writing Data to CSV*\n",
    "\n",
    "The script writes the scraped data (headline, link, date) to the CSV file and prints the data to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Script\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ensure all prerequisites are met.\n",
    "2. Adjust the `webdriver_path` variable to the correct path of your ChromeDriver.\n",
    "3. Run the script using Python:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python ledger_insights_scraper.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. The script will append new relevant articles to `ledgerinsights_articles.csv`.\n",
    "```"
