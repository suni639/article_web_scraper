# article_web_scraper
These scripts scrape article headlines, links, and publication dates from both the Ledger Insights and Blockworks websites. The scraped data is saved into two separate CSV files, appending new relevant articles each time the script is run.

See the specific ipynb file for more details on how to reproduce the scraper. Each script has its own nuances due to the idiosyncracies of the websites.
